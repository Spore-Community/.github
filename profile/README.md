# Sporepedia Archive
We want to preserve the 191 million creations created by over 5 million players! Visit the official Sporepedia here: http://www.spore.com/sporepedia

Our main archiving effort seeks to replicate all of these creations into both a new database and the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/), so that they can always be accessed by anyone. In addition, we have the [PNG Downloader](https://github.com/Spore-Community/PNG-Downloader), which lets anyone quickly download copies of all creations from any player or Sporecast.

# Community Sporepedia + Server
We want to build a new community-run Spore server to keep creation sharing alive indefinitely.

While the official servers remain online at this time, there will eventually be a time when EA shuts them down. We have projects to keep the online features working, through unofficial community-run servers.

We already have a mostly-functional server implementation, and a mod for the game that upgrades its netcode and adds the ability to connect to custom servers. See it here: https://github.com/Rosalie241/SporeServer

Additionally, while still in early stages, we are working on plans to host a custom server, potentially integrating with the Sporepedia Archive for a "drop-in" replacement for the official servers, preserving all the content, for a seamless transition to community-run servers.

### Related Projects
- [SporeServer](https://github.com/Rosalie241/SporeServer) - a functioning custom server that works with the game
- [Resurrection Capsule](https://github.com/vitor251093/resurrection-capsule) - a WIP custom server for Darkspore, an action RPG spin-off of Spore

# Modding
Mods add new parts, features, and even entire gamemodes to Spore. We want to promote Spore modding and make it as simple as possible to both use and create mods.

Community-run servers are also planned to have support for modded creations, something that has always been complicated with the official server.

Tools such as [SporeModder FX](https://emd4600.github.io/SporeModder-FX/) are critical to creating mods, and [Spore ModAPI](https://emd4600.github.io/Spore-ModAPI/) opens nearly-limitless possibilities for modifying and adding new functionality to the game. The [Mod Browser](https://mods.sporecommunity.com/) and new mod managers make it easy for players to find and install mods.

# Other Archiving
In addition to creations, we also seek to archive whatever other Spore-related content we can find.
